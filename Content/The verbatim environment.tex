\section{The verbatim environment}

With the Verbatim environment text can be displayed in a
\tsTextMonospace{Monospace} font. This is used to display source code.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{verbbox}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \small
    \centering
    \begin{BVerbatim}
        Sample code of verbatim environment.
    \end{BVerbatim}
    \tsCaptionLabelFigure{Verbatim Environment Demo}
\end{figure}
    \end{verbbox}
    \theverbbox
    \tsCaptionLabelFigure{Verbatim Environment Code}
\end{figure}

In order for the verbatim environment to get a signature, it is embedded in a
figure environment. The \tsTextMonospace{[H]} behind it makes sure that the
environment stays at the desired place in the text and does not end up
somewhere in the document.
\bigbreak

The adjustment of the font size is done as needed. A possible centering  is
achieved here using \tsTextMonospace{\tsBackslash{}centering}.
\bigbreak

\tsTextBold{Note:} If the verbatim environment is to be centered, the text that
is between \tsTextMonospace{\tsBackslash{}begin\{BVerbatim\}} and
\tsTextMonospace{\tsBackslash{}end\{BVerbatim\}} must be leftmost aligned in the
source code of the document. Otherwise the spaces will be part of the
alignment.
\bigbreak

The example from above then produces this result:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \small
    \centering
    \begin{BVerbatim}
Sample code of verbatim environment.
    \end{BVerbatim}

\end{figure}
