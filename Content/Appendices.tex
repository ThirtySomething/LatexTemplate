\section{Appendices}

In case you want to have appendices, there are two steps. The first one is
required to enable the appendices, the second one is the appendix itself.
For enabling remove the comment sign in the \tsTextItalic{TSTemplate-Meta.tex}
file:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \small
    \centering
    \begin{BVerbatim}
% Switch to enable appendix
\newif\ifUseTsAppendix
\UseTsAppendixtrue
    \end{BVerbatim}
    \tsCaptionLabelFigure{Enabling appendices}
\end{figure}

The second one is the usage of an appendix. You can have a look at the sources
in \tsTextItalic{TSTemplate-Appendix.tex} or use this example:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \small
    \centering
    \begin{BVerbatim}
\tsAppendixSection{README.md}
    \end{BVerbatim}
    \tsCaptionLabelFigure{Usage of tsAppendixSection}
\end{figure}

In this example the appendix \tsTextMonospace{README.md} is added and can be
referenced either by \tsTextMonospace{\tsBackslash{}nameref\{appendix:README.md\}}
(\nameref{appendix:README.md}) and/or
\tsTextMonospace{\tsBackslash{}ref\{appendix:README.md\}} (\ref{appendix:README.md}).
\bigbreak

In case you want to add a file to the appendix, you can also use the
\tsTextMonospace{\tsBackslash{}tsAppendixIncludeFile\{filename\}} command.
You can see the result in appendix \ref{appendix:vscode-latex-workshop.json},
which is done by

\begin{figure}[H]
    \small
    \centering
    \begin{BVerbatim}
\tsAppendixIncludeFile{vscode-latex-workshop.json}
    \end{BVerbatim}
    \tsCaptionLabelFigure{Usage of tsAppendixIncludeFile}
\end{figure}
